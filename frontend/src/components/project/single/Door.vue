      Developed a frontend application using Vue.js to control door access by
      integrating with a Laravel-based backend API for opening and closing
      operations. This project was collaboratively developed with a senior
      developer, ensuring clean architecture and efficient user interaction. The
      system supports real-time command execution and provides a user-friendly
      interface for access control management.
