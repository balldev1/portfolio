      Developed a system for a composting machine to transmit weight data to a
      website using Node.js and MQTT, with data stored in MongoDB. The frontend
      was built with Vue.js, while the backend API was developed using Laravel.
      C++ was used to interface directly with the MQTT protocol for real-time
      communication with the machine. Integrated a card reader for identity
      verification, handled via Node.js. The application was packaged into a
      desktop executable (.exe) using Electron. This project was collaboratively
      developed with a senior developer and is currently used internally within
      the company.
